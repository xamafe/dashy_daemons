# Dashy Daemons

A growing collection of small, focused Python daemons designed to fetch, process, and feed data into [Dashy](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy) dashboards.  

Currently included:  
- **Calendar Feed Generator** â€“ Pulls Google Calendar events and outputs a Dashy-friendly JSON feed.  
- **VRR EFA API Data Fetcher** â€“ Retrieves real-time public transport departure data from the VRR network for display in Dashy.  

Future daemons may cover other APIs or data sources.  

## Notes
- All daemons are independent â€” check their individual folders for setup and usage instructions.  
- Your Mileage may vary depending on your environment, API availability, and configuration. "Works on my machine" ... ðŸ˜‰
